## 🌟 Overview

The **FBMP Skimmer** was created with a simple but ambitious goal:  
> *Find the best deal on a car without manually refreshing Facebook Marketplace every hour.*

Instead of endlessly scrolling through listings, this bot continuously monitors Facebook Marketplace in the background. Given parameters like **make, model, year, and mileage**, it automatically detects new posts and sends real-time notifications so you never miss a good deal.

## 📖 Background

This project started as an experiment in the **winter of my 1st year of engineering**.  
Armed with the base Jupyter notebook from the parent repository and some Python skills I picked up in my intro engineering programming course, I decided to push the project further:  

- Added **custom search parameters** beyond the defaults  
- Integrated a **Discord bot** to make the tool more practical  
- Learned a ton about web scraping, data handling, and automation along the way  

What started as a small class-inspired side project turned into a tool I still use today.
