Facebook Marketplace Scraper Using Python, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Pandas...

<h3>
  Created this with the goal to find the best deal for a car on facebook marketplace.

  This bot automatically skims Facebook marketplace and given the specific model year and mileage will notify when a new listing is posted as lonng as the bot is running in the background of my computer.

  I used the parent repository of this fork for the base jupyter code and using the skills I learned in my first year of engineering python course which is quite similar I added more search parameters and a discord bot 
to send me a notification on discord when new listings were found.
